# Emoji Search for Ubuntu

Emoji Search Ubuntu is a simple emoji picker for Ubuntu 14.04+ running Unity 7 and some other GNU/Linux distributions and desktop environments.

This project is proudly using emoji data from the [Emoji One](http://emojione.com/) project.


###  Standalone installer (should work on any distro!)

This method does not require root access. If you run it as root, the searcher will be installed for all users.

  1. Clone the repository and cd into it
  2. Run `./install.sh`
  4. If you want to uninstall it later, just run `./install.sh` again.

## How to run it

If you want to manually run it right now, just press `Alt+F2` and write the command `emoji-search`. 
The better way is to create a keyboard shortcut for `emoji-search`.

## How to use it

  1. Type keyword in search box 
  2. Select the emojis (Slections will appear at bottom)
  2. Paste it (usually `Ctrl+V`) wherever you want!
